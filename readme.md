#### TODO:


#### Done:

- we need a way to mark people when take use their challenge. so the moderator knows they are not allowed to get another challange. how can we add an option to mark people as "challage used" in the page "Step 1 of 2 • Voting".  we already have cards for each player and I don't want to add more cards

- After negotation happend, the reporter can make an inquiry (only one night) and see if someone was negotiated. something like detective. They get a thumbs up if the person they chose was negotiated.

- Armored won't die the first time they're voted out, but after that, they will be killed at nights if they're shot.

- Nato's correct guess doesn't kill the person and also mafia team can make a shot and guess at the same time which is not possible.

- we should see a list of available roles not and should not have to write down the role name "Guessed role name". also when we go back to that night, it still says "NATO — Role Guess (once per game)
NATO already used the role-guess ability."

- In addition to making the "cast page" blury, can we make it darker too? it hurts the eyes when it's blury and so bright. Also there's a bug on the cast.hide button, when we switch language, it shows a weird name "cast.hide" or "cast.reveal" instead of proper English or Farsi texts. Also by default we should see the cast list.

- NATO doesn't seem to have a night role in the game, but it should, study internet.

- In the cast page where we see list of players and their roles, the moderator's phone screen might be seen by accident by a player. is there a way to blur those info and when moderator holds their finger on screen it's not blurry anymore? do you think that's a good idea or are there better more user friendly ways to do it?

- when researcher links himself to Mafia (other than mafia boss), and researcher gets voted out, we should also display message that that  mafia will also go out.

- The triangle icon for "Flow" has very sharp corners and doesn't look modern.

- Instead of the title being "Mafia Game Assistant", it could be "Mafia: {Scenario Name}"

- "Rebel (Yaghee)", doesn't need to have (Yaghee), it can just be "Rebel". make sure there's no Finglish words in Role names, they should be either Farsi or English

- How come when I switch between English and Farsi, the English fonts are much clearer to read while Farsi fonts are not as readable?

- by now you've learned a lot about each scenario and know where to find more info. But why I'm not seeing correct list of roles for some scenarios, such as "Representative"?

- add a new button under "flow" and "status", called "timer". it should open up a window in which we can see 3 timers, "turn", "challange" and "defence". This is just in case people don't want to use the "flow" button.

- Now look at guides we have and make sure scenario "representative" has the correct game flow

- Write comprehensive game guides for each senario that can be accessed from "Help" button for each scenario. Make them as complete as possible. Search internet and make sure all the rules and guides for each scenario, day and night phases (and possibly anything inbetween) roles and rules are correct. We want these to be so comprehensive that anyone looking at them would know what happens in every moment of the game. Basically it should be a guide that can be used to create sudo code of the full game application. These can both be used by the moderator and we can also use them to make this application more robust and correct. Make sure to save these in a separate file, not in index.html. We want to keep things as clean as possible.
